        The National University Of Battambang (NUBB) was founded by <strong> SAMDECH KROLAHOM SAR KHENG </strong>, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister Of Interior, in 2007 with the vision of providing opportunities to students living in rural areas, especially in north-western Cambodia. These opportunities include access to higher education and services that contribute towards the development of their individual careers as well as to that of local communities while at the same time reducing the knowledge gap between the rural and urban population.
